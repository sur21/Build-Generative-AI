# Build-Generative-AI-Using HuggingFace Open Source Models And Langchain
This project demonstrates how to build powerful Generative AI applications by combining Hugging Face's open-source models with the LangChain framework. By leveraging pre-trained language models from Hugging Face and LangChain's capabilities for creating modular chains, you can create dynamic, AI-driven applications.

# Key Features
Hugging Face Integration: Utilize a wide range of pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT, BERT) for tasks like text generation, question answering, summarization, etc.
LangChain Framework: Orchestrate complex chains of tasks, connect LLMs to external data sources, memory systems, and APIs.
Custom AI Pipelines: Build modular AI workflows that handle everything from creative content generation to multi-step reasoning.
# Use Cases
Virtual Assistants,
Automated Content Creation.
Conversational Agents, and
AI-powered Decision Support
